## Channel Information
One of the biggest and most versatile features of this plugin is the channel system.
There are 3 main channel types:

- StringChannel\
  A channel that does not consider the player's world or proximity.
- WorldChannel\
  A channel that only works in one specific world, unless the channel manually joined.
- ProximityChannel\
  A channel that only sends messages to players within the right proximity of the sender, unless the channel is manually joined.

Some additional features available to channels are per-channel formatting, priority and default membership.

**Channel Membership:**\
There are two options for channel `membership`, and those are `default` and `permission`.  Default channels are available to all players, regardless of permissions, as long as they are within the scope of the channel.

**Priority:**\
Each channel can be designated a certain priority, the higher the number, the higher the priority.  This only matters for channels with `membership: default`, as priority will determine what channel a player's message will be sent in.

**Default Channels:**\
Both channel membership and priority work together to offer a key piece of functionality, the default channel.  Every player has an active channel set, however, internally there is a channel type that does not process messages, rather it designates the appropriate channel a player's message should be sent in, considering world, priority and membership.


**Developer:**\
Nearly all of the things listed in this section, and more are customizable through the API.  For more information, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Wiicart/Strings/wiki).
## Developer
I've added a public API which will be available through Maven soon.  The API is currently published through [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Wiicart/Strings/releases).
