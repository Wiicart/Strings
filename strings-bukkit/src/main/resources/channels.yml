# Strings - Channels
#
# All channels are defined in this channel, and information about them is stored here.
# No matter what, a "global" channel will be present, even if this file is empty.
# If you want to prevent players from sending messages in this channel, you can set it to disabled.
# Permission to join a channel is given by the permission strings.channel.<channel-name>
# The channels a player is a member of is stored in users.yml, if none of those channels exist,
# the player will join the default "global" channel.
# Note: a user can be a member of and receive messages from multiple channels, but messages will
# only be sent to the player's active channel.
# The default channel is "global".

    # This allows other plugins to receive the message and modify it.
    # It's recommended to keep this on unless you want no other plugins to receive or modify chat.
    # BUG: This will be fixed, but currently if events are not called, cool downs will not work.

    # The Channel membership.
    # Options:
    # - default
    #     All members receive channels from default membership channels.  If a user's active channel is default, default channels
    #     are considered when deciding what channel the message will be sent to.
    # - permission
    #     Players are not members of permission membership channels by default, but may still recieve messages by default if
    #     they have the proper permission.

    # Prefix
    # When a player types this prefix before their message in chat, it will be sent to this channel, as long as the
    # player has permission.  This should only be one character, or else it will NOT work.

  # Below are examples of a world channel and a proximity channel.
  # World channels have the additional configuration option of "world", which is required or else the channel
  # will not be created in game when loading.  As the name suggests, by default only players that are in the world that
  # the channel is configured to.
  #
  # Proximity channels have the additional option of "distance", which is measured in blocks.  Messages sent via this type
  # of channel are only sent to players within the specified distance.
  #
  # Both of these channel types can be joined with the /channel join command to receive messages regardless of world or
  # location on the server for moderation purposes.

  # SocialSpy also runs on a type of channel, and customizations for it are found in config.yml
  # Just as the HelpOP channel, it does not behave like a normal channel and normal channel commands will not work with it.
  # In game, the /socialspy command is how you use the socialspy channel.
