# Strings - Channels

# All channels are defined in this channel, and information about them is stored here.
# Permission to join a channel is given by the permission strings.channel.<channel-name>.
# The channels a player is a member of are stored in users.yml, if none of those channels exist,
# the player will join the channel "default" which will determine what channel to send the message to.

channels:
  global:
    # The format messages should be posted as in the channel.
    # Valid placeholders:
    # {displayname} - player display name
    # {prefix} - player prefix
    # {suffix} - player suffix
    # {message} - the player's message
    # (!) NOTE: Compatible with PlaceholderAPI placeholders
    format: "{prefix}{displayname}{suffix} &7» &f{message}"
    # Should an event be called when players send a message?
    # This allows other plugins to receive the message and modify it.
    # It's recommended to keep this on unless you want no other plugins to receive or modify chat.
    # BUG: This will be fixed, but currently if events are not called, cool downs will not work.

    # Should chat be filtered for profanity?
    # Requires StringsModeration expansion available on Modrinth

    # Channel Type
    # Options:
    # - stringchannel - a server wide channel, messages are sent to every player that is a member.
    # - proximity - as the name says, proximity
    # - world - a channel that only works for one world
    # Global MUST be a stringchannel.

    # The Channel membership.
    # Options:
    # - default
    #     All members receive channels from default membership channels.  If a user's active channel is default, default channels
    #     are considered when deciding what channel the message will be sent to.
    # - permission
    #     Players are not members of permission membership channels by default, but may still recieve messages by default if
    #     they have the proper permission.
    membership: default
    # Priority
    # When a player has the channel of default, the channel that the player's message will be sent to is determined by
    # priority.  The higher the number, the higher the priority.
    priority: 1
    # Message Deletion
    # Should messages be allowed to be deleted in this Channel?
    message-deletion: false
    # Symbol
    # When a player types this symbol before their message in chat, it will be sent to this channel, as long as the
    # player has permission.  Despite its name, this may contain multiple characters.
    # WARNING:
    # If used with world and proximity channels, this allows players to communicate in these channels, regardless of
    # if they are in the right world to use the channel.
    symbol: ""
    # Broadcast Format
    # When a message is broadcast using the /broadcast command, what should the format be?
    # Valid placeholders:
    # {message} - the message being broadcast

  # Help OP channel.
  # This channel does not behave like a normal channel, as membership of the channel and

  # Below are examples of a world channel and a proximity channel.
  # World channels have the additional configuration option of "world", which is required or else the channel
  # will not be created in game when loading.  As the name suggests, by default only players that are in the world that
  # the channel is configured to.
  #
  # Proximity channels have the additional option of "distance", which is measured in blocks.  Messages sent via this type
  # of channel are only sent to players within the specified distance.

  # SocialSpy also runs on a type of channel, and customizations for it are found in config.yml
  # Just as the HelpOP channel, it does not behave like a normal channel,
  # and normal channel commands will not work with it.
  # In game, the /socialspy command is how you use the socialspy channel.
